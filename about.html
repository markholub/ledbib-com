*****New Album Coming on Cuneiform Records in 2025*****
<p>
<br>
Led Bib are one of the UK’s most daring and acclaimed bands, smashing through genre boundaries with a sound that fuses jazz, rock, improv and noise into something entirely their own. Formed in 2003 by drummer and composer Mark Holub, the group have released 11 albums, toured internationally, and picked up major accolades—including a Mercury Prize nomination for their breakout record Sensible Shoes. From the raw energy of their early releases to the vocal-led experimentation of It’s Morning and the bold reinvention of their latest album Hotel Pupik, Led Bib have consistently earned critical acclaim for their restless creativity and explosive live shows. Now reimagined as a keyboard-less quartet, the band continues to evolve, with a renewed sound that’s deeper, more melodic, and as fearless as ever. Over 20 years in, Led Bib are still making music that’s impossible to pin down—and impossible to ignore.</div>
