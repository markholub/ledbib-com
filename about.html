<p>Drummer and composer Mark Holub formed Led Bib in 2003 for a university
masters project. Made up of his Middlesex university friends, the five piece
played its first gig at London&#x2019;s Klinker Club on February 24th 2004 to
ten people in the backroom of a North London pub. Five years later they were
performing on primetime TV to millions, having been nominated as a Mercury
Prize album of the year. Theirs was a full gas acceleration to that point.
Having had their first album met with widespread critical praise in May 2005,
they also won the Peter Whittingham Jazz Award in the same year. A second
album, Sizewell Tea released in 2007 through iconic London label Babel brought
more interest, bigger features, better reviews. There was a notable shift in
numbers too, audiences grew as fans cottoned on to a new jazz movement, of
which Led Bib was a frontrunner, ditching the noodling and pulling more into
rock territory. As they drew references from across the musical spectrum
Beefheart and Zorn, Pink Floyd and Miles Davis so too did they draw in a larger
swathe of interest, drum and bass heads, jazz aficionados, death metalists and
folk, world music and pop fans were, in equal number, their audience.</p>

<p>A limited edition live release appeared in 2008, but it was the release of
their 4th album Sensible Shoes that saw them experience widespread acclaim
following the announcement that they were chosen as an Album of the Year in the
2009 Barclaycard Mercury Prize. The ensuing media storm saw them reach in
excess of 20 million people as they performed on TV &amp; Radio sessions
including Channel 4 TV News with Jon Snow, playing live on BBC 2 and found a
befuddled and unlikely pundit in Holub being asked to explain the likes of
&#x201c;what is jazz?&#x201d; to the masses of early morning BBC breakfast
radio listeners .</p>

<p>In 2011 the group released Bring Your Own, their second album for US based
Cuneiform Records. Quickly hailed as a stand out success it gained 4 and 5 star
reviews across the board. 2014 saw the release of two new albums to celebrate
their 10th anniversary, the studio album 'The People in Your Neighbourhood' and
the limited edition live vinyl 'The Good Egg', both hailed as modern classics
and there best yet. 2017 sees the band release their eagerly anticipated 6th
studio album and first with genre defying London label Rare Noise Records, a
tour of Europe and the UK will be done in support. Will the next 10 years take
them on a similarly unpredictable journey? Whatever happens, it&#x2019;ll be
interesting to watch.</p>
